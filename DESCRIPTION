        Differentiation

Description: Provides functions that allow users to quantify the relative 
	contributions of geographic and ecological distances to empirical patterns of genetic 
	differentiation on a landscape.  Specifically, we use a custom Markov chain 
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which is used to estimate the parameters of the 
	inference model, as well as functions for performing MCMC diagnosis and assessing 
	model adequacy.
